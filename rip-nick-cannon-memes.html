The beef started when Eminem released a new song that made another dig at his past relationship with Mariah Carey (the two only dated for six months in 2001, and Mariah claims it never even happened).&nbsp;</p><p>Well, Nick, who was married to Mariah from 2008 to 2016, wasn't a huge fan of that. Nick and Mariah are still on good terms, and they co-parent their children together still.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The #RIPNickCannon memes are hilarious.</h2><p>In response to Eminem's diss to Mariah, Nick released a diss track of his own — and let's just say he's clearly not winning.</p><p>Twitter thought his track was hilariously awful, and in response, there have been more than a few <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"#RIPNickCannon" memes</a> gaining traction on the site. Here's a roundup of the best memes from their fight.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A rare pic of me listening to Nick's diss track<a href=#>#ripnickcannon</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hMZN5Y7QKZ</a></p>— Fer Rouq (@SocialOutcast47) <a href=#>December 10, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The hashtag #RIPNickCannon started trending on Twitter.</h2><p>In what's probably the biggest diss to Nick, Eminem fans started tweeting with the hashtag #RIPNickCannon, making fun of his track. And since it's the internet, no one's holding back.&nbsp;</p><p>One user tweeted, "A rare pic of me listening to Nick's diss track," showing someone sitting next to a garbage can with headphones leading into it. Another tweeted,&nbsp;"Nick Cannon waking up and seeing #ripnickcannon trending after he thought he shut Eminem down with a diss track," captioning a video of a little boy throwing a fit.</p><p>Clearly, Eminem's got a lot more people on his side than Nick ever expected him to. We're also a little surprised at the support shown for him, since he hasn't been too popular lately.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nick Cannon waking up and seeing <a href=#>#ripnickcannon</a> trending after he thought he shut Eminem down with a diss track. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1IgajUkoHl</a></p>— Ladyday13 (@Ladyday132) <a href=#>December 10, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Someone started a GoFundMe to donate to Nick's funeral.</h2><p>Another user tweeted a screenshot of a GoFundMe that was set up for "Nick Cannon's Career Funeral," asking for a goal of only $1.
