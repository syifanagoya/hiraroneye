The series concluded in 1988, but those who watched will be glad to hear that the stars are still friends. This is something that <strong>Mindy Cohn</strong>, who played Natalie, insists on. While fans have gotten to watch the stars reunite onscreen, Cohn says these TV specials and movies don't feel like a reunion for them, because they're still in touch.</p><p>While Cohn will always be known as The Facts of Life's Natalie, she's also associated with another famous character and has taken on many other TV and movie roles over the years. Read on to learn more about Cohn's life and career today.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Blair From The Facts of Life Now at 58</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Mindy-Kim.jpg><p>Cohn has kept acting consistently since The Facts of Life ended. Some of her recent work includes appearances on the shows Bones and The Middle, and roles in the movies A Nice Girl Like You and You Light Up My Christmas, the latter of which starred her Facts of Life co-star <strong>Kim Fields</strong> (Tootie) and also featured<strong> Lisa Whelchel</strong> (Blair) and <strong>Nancy McKeon</strong> (Jo).</p><p>Cohn is also a voice actor, and for a long time <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>she voiced Velma</a> in various Scooby-Doo projects. "For me, I just feel so lucky that I got to voice her for the 15 years that I did," Cohn said on the podcast Everything Iconic with Danny Pellegrino. "She's an icon."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/Mindy-2021.jpg><p>Cohn began her podcast, Mondays with Mindy, in 2020, and she co-hosts with <strong>Christian Brescia</strong>. "Each week we're going to pull back the curtain on our guest's creative process," Cohn explained in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>preview of the podcast</a>. "We're going to talk to creatives of all different kinds: writers, producers, directors, actors, yes, but also people in publishing, food, and, let's be honest, I think most jobs can be very creative, so really the sky's the limit." Guests have included fashion designer <strong>Isaac Mizrahi</strong>, comedian <strong>Margaret Cho</strong>, and singer <strong>Carnie Wilson</strong>. Cohn has also interviewed her friends and co-stars Fields, McKeon, and Whelchel.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p><strong>RELATED: For more celebrity news delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/mindy-2017.jpg><p>In 2017, Cohn revealed in an interview with People that she had been <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>diagnosed with breast cancer</a> in 2012. She underwent a double mastectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy—she referred to her years of treatment as a "siege"—and was cancer-free by the time she shared her diagnosis publicly.

In 2019, they came together for You Light Up My Christmas, and in 2021, Whelchel, Fields, and Cohn appeared on the special Live in Front of a Studio Audience together.</p><p>In her interview on Everything Iconic, Cohn spoke about You Light Up My Christmas—which starred and was executive produced by Fields—and shared how it didn't really feel like a reunion for herself and her co-stars. "To call it a reunion was hard for us, because it wasn't. It was us doing Kim a solid," she said. 'It's always great for us to be together, but we stay in touch, so it wasn't a reunion for us."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See the Little Brother From Growing Pains All Grown Up</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmp5mklrmqsYyfmJyso2K8p3nLop2eZZ2eu6XFjJymoaZdo7y4ec2erqxn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./godfrey-cambridge-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Godfrey Cambridge Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family And More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./salma-hayek-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Salma Hayek Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebration-in-verse-form-html.html>Celebration in verse form</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelan-sisti-net-worth.html>Michelan Sisti Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lawrence-long.html>Lawrence Long (Jeopardy) Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-norvell.html>Who is Kim Norvell?
