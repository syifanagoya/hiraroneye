Though he allegedly left in the spring the following year, Timothee's legacy at the campus apparently lived on. In 2018, a rumor started to spread that the young actor had a sexually transmitted disease.</p><p>"Mutual friend got chlamydia from Timothee Chalamet, pass it on," a person tweeted at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The ongoing rumor is that the award-winning actor had spread chlamydia throughout the NYU campus. Seriously, people...?</p><p>"Timothée Chalamet spread chlamydia across the NYU campus and all I’m saying is that it’s one pill and I’m in the east village <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealChalamet</a>," a fan tweeted. Though nothing was ever confirmed, the rumor continues to surface a few times each year.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thinking about how I found out Timothée Chalamet gave a whole a-- class at my school chlamydia," tweeted this person. Additionally, someone wrote, "Was informed last night that timothee chalamet caused a chlamydia outbreak at nyu and idk how to feel about it."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"How did i not know about the timothee chalamet chlamydia," a person wrote.

During the table read, he says a homophobic slur, which was taken out of context.</p><p>The anti-gay slur was said because it is a line in the play Tennessee.&nbsp;</p><p>And, fans have not stopped there. The hashtag #TimothéeChalametIsOverParty went viral after old photos of the actor kissing Selena Gomez resurfaced on TikTok. The pics were from the Woody Allen film A Rainy Day in New York. So, the two are not dating nor are they in a relationship; they were filming a movie together.&nbsp;</p><p>While we get the Timothée hype, the rumors about his personal life should cease.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauu9OhnJ5lk52ura3Mnqtmm5ihrq7Fw6KY</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./valerie-bertinelli-catches-burglars-outside-of-her-home-on-camera.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Valerie Bertinelli Catches Burglars Outside Of Her Home On Camera</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tamra-judge-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tamra Judge Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebration-in-verse-form-html.html>Celebration in verse form</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelan-sisti-net-worth.html>Michelan Sisti Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lawrence-long.html>Lawrence Long (Jeopardy) Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-norvell.html>Who is Kim Norvell?
