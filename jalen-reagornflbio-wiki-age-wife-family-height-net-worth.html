He scored his first collegiate touchdown two weeks later when he caught a Hail Mary pass from quarterback Kenny Hill on the last play of the first half in a victory over SMU. He scored touchdowns in each of the last four games of the season, which included TCU’s first-ever appearance in the Big 12 Championship Game and a win in the 2017 Alamo Bowl over Stanford. For his efforts, he was named Co-Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year.</p><p>Prior to his sophomore season, Reagor switched to jersey number 1 from the 18 he’d worn in 2017.[8] That fall, he became the Frogs’ go-to receiver in a season in which they used three different starting quarterbacks, becoming the first TCU receiver to top 1,000 yards since Josh Doctson. He had a streak of 7 straight games with a receiving touchdown, which included a win against Oklahoma State in which he also recorded his first career 100-yard rushing game. After the season, he was named 2nd-team All-Big 12. Following his 2019 season with 43 catches for 611 yards, Reagor also declared for the 2020 NFL Draft after this season, forgoing his final year of eligibility.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jalen-reagor-strengths></span><span>Jalen Reagor Strengths</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Reagor is an agile receiver who can win in the short area of the field and is explosive with the ball in his hands, as evidenced by the rushing, punt return and kick return yardage he racked up in his three-year career. In fact, Reagor became just the 12th FBS player to total at least 2,000 receiving yards, 300 rushing yards, and 300 of each type of return yardage, joining a list that features names like T.Y. Hilton, Antonio Brown, Wes Welker and Jeremy Maclin.<br>Despite his height, Reagor’s leaping ability also makes him a threat down the field, and his impressive sophomore campaign was full of long touchdowns.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jalen-reagor-net-worth></span><span>Jalen Reagor Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jalen has not revealed his net worth.
