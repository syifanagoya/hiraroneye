into the net worth of the late Godfrey presents a challenge, primarily because he passed away in 1976, and financial records from that era are not as detailed or accessible as contemporary celebrities’.</p><p>However, during his time, Cambridge was among the highest-earning comedians and actors, rivalling peers such as <strong>Raymond St. Jacques</strong>, <strong>Calvin Lockhart</strong>, and <strong>Melvin Van Peebles</strong>.</p><p>While specific figures are hard to come by, the scale and scope of his work in film, stage, and stand-up comedy, including headlining prestigious venues like San Francisco’s Hungry i and Hollywood’s Crescendo, suggest that his financial success was significant.</p><p>Unlike the comprehensive financial data available for today’s celebrities, understanding the wealth of figures from the past like Cambridge requires a nuanced look at their career’s breadth and impact rather than exact figures.</p><h2><span
