Even when you find one you think is decent, it usually doesn’t do enough. You still need other products to make up for what it lacks. We prefer a product that can not only save our skin, but also our time and the space in our medicine cabinet/on our vanity!</p><p>A multitasking moisturizer that actually gets it right? Rare. They’re out there though. You might even find one…right here! COVER FX, a celeb-loved makeup brand, just debuted its first ever skincare launch, introducing its new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Custom Blending Moisturizer</a> to the world. It was truly a stunning debut, but now is actually the best time to buy — it’s 20% off for a limited time!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cover-fx-moisturizer-before-after.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Custom Blending Moisturizer</a> (originally $42) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> with code TWENTY at COVER FX! Sale ends January 19, 2021.</strong></p><p>You may know COVER FX for its famous primers, as even The Flight Attendant star <strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong> wore one on her wedding day. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This new moisturizer</a> still acts as a primer, creating “a smooth, even canvas for makeup application,” but it may have some amazing long-term effects too. It’s infused with prebiotic and probiotic complexes to “balance your skin’s living protective layer,” acting as a powerful anti-aging tool with results that may build and build over time. Age-accelerating environmental stressors are about to seriously get what’s coming to them!</p><p>This unique moisturizer is “the answer to both your skincare and makeup prep needs.” You can wear it on its own, applying it after cleansing and before sunscreen in the mornings or just before bed at night, but its ultra-blendable formula can also be mixed with makeup for a seriously supple glow!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Custom Blending Moisturizer</a> (originally $42) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> with code TWENTY at COVER FX! Sale ends January 19, 2021.</strong></p><p>If you’re using this moisturizer on its own, you can apply it to your face with clean fingers. If you want to use it with liquid makeup, however, you might want to try a makeup brush, dotting each product on top and then blending. Maybe you’ll love it with your foundation for all-over hydration, or maybe you’ll love the extra dewiness it adds to a blush or bronzer!</p><p>This product is new to the beauty world, but one reviewer is already calling it their “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">prized possession</a>,” loving how it “quite literally makes a smooth canvas on your face.” And how about the fact that it’s vegan, cruelty-free and free of fragrance, gluten, mineral oil, parabens, phthalates, sulfates and talc? Clean beauty has never looked so good — and it was already great in the first place, so that says a lot!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Custom Blending Moisturizer</a> (originally $42) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$34</a> with code TWENTY at COVER FX!
