He was born and raised in Henderson, Nevada, United States. Chumlee's age is currently 39 years. However, not much is known about his parents.</p><p class=align-left>He was nicknamed Chumlee by his father because of the amount of flesh on his face and chin. The name was adapted from a character in an animated series known as <i>Chumley.</i></p><p class=align-left>Chumlee's siblings are two, and he is the eldest. His younger brother and sister are Sage Russell and Terra Russell, respectively. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">celebrated Sage's graduation</a> from <a href=#>high school</a> because the boy was the first graduate in the Russell family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5e720fca09c39082.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Chumlee <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had a childhood friend</a>, Corey Harrison, whose father and grandfather had a large Pawn Shop in Las Vegas. He gained employment at the Pawn Shop when he came of age. Corey's father, Rick Harrison, allowed him to attend to customers.</p><p class=align-left>Five years into his working experience, Rick Harrison struck a deal with History Channel, and this was how the reality <a href=#>television series</a>, <i>Pawn Stars,</i> started. The series explored the day to day life of employees and their customers within and outside the store.</p><p class=align-left>At first, Chumlee played minor roles and was the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">butt of the series' jokes </a>because of his appearance and the assumption that he was not intelligent. However, his roles were expanded as the series grew popular.</p><h2>What happened to Chumlee?</h2><p class=align-left>The easygoing actor appeared to be living a life devoid of lawlessness, but this opinion must have changed after the raid on his house in 2016. The police raided Chumlee's house because of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sexual assault levelled against him</a>. However, the discoveries made were alarming.</p><p class=align-left>Controlled substances like Xanax, Methamphetamine, marijuana, and traces of what could be cocaine were found in his residence. The police also discovered <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">12 different firearms</a> in his home, including revolvers, shotguns, and rifles, four of which were registered in his name.</p><p class=align-left>He was arrested on the 9th of March the same year but released on bail the next day after paying around $62,000. More so, he was arraigned in <a href=#>court</a> on the 11th of March, 2016, on several felony charges that included illegal possession of firearms and drugs. Chumlee <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pleaded guilty</a> and got three years of probation with a mandatory counselling session.</p><h2>How did Chumlee lose weight?</h2><p class=align-left>The actor went on a weight loss journey after his biological father passed away due to pancreatic cancer. He was on a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">strict diet</a> that included doing away with processed food, drinking plenty of fruit juice, and eating loads of vegetables. The businessman also visited the gym six times a week.</p><p class=align-left>Chumlee's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">weight loss experience</a> included gastric surgery to remove his belly fat. This was inspired by his friend Corey Harrison, who had done the same some years back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/523a6188e1155de3.jpg><h2>Is Chumlee married?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, he is. So, who is Chumlee <i>Pawn Stars'</i> wife? He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met his wife</a>, Olivia Rademann, while going through the 2016 scandal. Three years later, they wedded in Hawaii.</p><p class=align-left>However, rumours have it that there is a bit of trouble between Chumlee's wife Olivia Rademann and himself. This was triggered by Chumleeâ€™s decision to delete their pictures together on his Instagram page. The reason for these actions are unknown, and the rumours are unfounded.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Chumlee's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> is an estimated $5 million. He makes this fortune from his acting career in the <i>Pawn Star</i> reality show, where he is paid $25,000 for every episode he appears.</p><h3>Chumlee's candy store</h3><p class=align-left>The actor also started a merchandise store where he sells different things that interests him. In addition, he established a candy shop in 2017 to increase his sources of revenue.</p><p class=align-left>His brother, Sage Russell, is responsible for the smooth running of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chumlee candy store</a>. At some point, Chumlee sold almost half of his shares at the Pawn Shop to Rick Harrison to meet the needs of his increasing customersâ€™ demands.</p><h3>Coin</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chumlee's coin</a> is part of the merchandise that you can find in the actorâ€™s store. Thanks to his fame from playing Chumlee in <i>Pawn Stars</i>, he is making good cash from his businesses.</p><p class=align-left>Chumlee has proven that he is not the village idiot he was assumed to be with his impressive net worth accompanied by a string of lucrative <a href=#>business</a> and a determination to live a healthy life. The television star enjoys playing video games and collecting sneakers; he owns over 200 shoe pairs.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Zari Hassan: age, children, spouse, career, house, net worth, profiles</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>We</a> published an article about <a href=#>Zari Hassan</a>.
