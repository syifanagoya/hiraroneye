He has been in the coaching business for over three decades, working with various teams and players. But behind every successful coach, there is a supportive partner. And for Jay Norvell, that partner is his wife, Kim Norvell.</p><p>Kim is not just a football coach’s wife. She is also a brave woman who has overcome many challenges in her life. She has battled cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder that affects the lungs and other organs, since she was six years old.</p><p>She has also survived colon cancer, which was diagnosed in 2016.

She is the daughter of Bob and Delores Fehrman, who have been married for over 60 years. They met when they were in kindergarten and attended Catholic school together until they graduated. They had her when they were young and raised her with love and care.</p><p>Kim was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) when she was six years old. CF is a condition that causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs, making it hard to breathe and digest food. It can also lead to infections, inflammation, and damage to the organs. There is no cure for CF, and the average life expectancy for people with CF is about 40 years.</p><p>Her parents were devastated when they learned about her condition. They were told that she might not live past first grade. But they did not lose hope. They surrounded her with good friends, neighbors, and people who cared for her. They also encouraged her to pursue her interests and hobbies. She loved to play with the neighborhood kids, cheer for her high school teams, and listen to rap music. She was a fan of the rap group NWA, and even took her son to watch their biopic, Straight Outta Compton.</p><p>Kim did not let CF stop her from living her life. She said, “Don’t boo hoo me, Dad. I’m fine.” She learned to cope with her condition and manage her symptoms. She had to cough and wear a special vest every morning to clear her airway. She also had to take a lot of pills and injections to treat her infections and complications. She was careful not to overwork herself, as it could worsen her condition. But she also liked to be active and involved in things that made her happy.</p><p>She attended the University of Wisconsin for her higher education. She studied business and marketing, and graduated with a degree in 1991. It was during her college days that she met Jay Norvell, the man who would become her husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kim-Norvell-bio-1024x768.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kim Norvell has always been supportive of her husband’s career as a football coach.

She has hosted dinners and parties for the players and their families, organized fundraisers and auctions, and volunteered for charities and causes. She has also been an advocate for cystic fibrosis awareness and research, sharing her story and inspiring others.</p><p>Kim Norvell has also pursued her own passions and interests, such as music, fashion, and travel. She has a keen sense of style and loves to dress up and accessorize. She has a collection of shoes, bags, and jewelry, which she likes to mix and match.</p><p>She also enjoys listening to music, especially rap and hip-hop. She has a soft spot for Eminem, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar. She also likes to travel and explore new places, cultures, and cuisines. She has visited many countries, such as Italy, France, Spain, and Mexico.</p><p>Kim has also been a devoted mother to her son, Jaden, who is also a talented rapper. She has nurtured his musical talent and supported his aspirations. She is proud of his skills but also worries about some of the words he uses in his songs. She said, “He’s very good at what he does, but sometimes I cringe at the language. But I guess that’s rap.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Norvells_Marriage_to_Jay_Norvell></span>Kim Norvell’s Marriage to Jay Norvell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She and Jay Norvell met in 1991, when Jay was an assistant coach for the Wisconsin Badgers, and Kim was a student at the university. They had a friendly rivalry, as they came from different high schools that competed against each other. Jay teased her about how her high school cheated when they played basketball. They got to know each other and fell in love.</p><p>They dated for six years, and got married in 1997.

She said, “He’s a wonderful man. He’s a great dad. He’s a great coach. He loves what he does. He’s very good at what he does. He’s very passionate about what he does.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Her_Son_Jaden></span>Her Son, Jaden<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kim and Jay Norvell have one son, Jaden, who was born in 2000.

He also learned from his father, who taught him how to work hard and pursue his dreams. He said, “My mom is the one who got me into rap. She’s always been a big fan of rap. She’s always played it in the car, in the house, everywhere. My dad is the one who taught me how to grind. He’s always been working hard, always been chasing his goals. He’s always been motivating me to do the same.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kim-Norvell-with-her-husband-1024x959.jpg><p>Jaden is also a football fan, and supports his father and his team.

The two coaches exchanged some harsh words, which were captured on the latest episode of “Coach Prime,” a documentary series about Sanders’ coaching journey.</p><p>The drama started earlier in the week when Norvell remarked on Sanders’ habit of wearing hats and sunglasses during press conferences.&nbsp;Norvell said, “When I talk to grown-ups, I take my hat and my glasses off.”&nbsp;This comment sparked a furious reaction from Sanders and his players, who felt disrespected and insulted by Norvell.</p><p>Sanders responded by saying, “I don’t know what he’s talking about. I don’t know what he’s trying to accomplish. I don’t know what he’s trying to prove.&nbsp;But he’s going to get what he’s looking for.”&nbsp;He also warned the viewers to keep the cameras rolling after the game, implying that there would be a showdown between him and Norvell.</p><p>The game itself was a nail-biter, as Colorado and Colorado State traded blows and went into overtime tied at 31-31. Colorado scored a touchdown on their first possession, but Colorado State answered with a touchdown of their own. In the second overtime, Colorado State settled for a field goal, giving Colorado a chance to win the game with a touchdown. Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, Deion’s son, delivered the game-winning pass to receiver Dimitri Stanley, sending the Buffaloes fans into a frenzy.</p><p>As the fans stormed the field, Deion and Norvell met at midfield for a brief handshake. However, the conversation quickly turned sour, as Deion accused Norvell of talking trash about his mother. “You was talking about my mama,” Deion said to Norvell. “You was talking about my mama.&nbsp;You was talking about my mama.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Height_Weight></span>Height, Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Height</strong>: 5 feet 1 inch or 155 cm</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: 45 kg or 99 lbs</li><li><strong>Eye color</strong>: Hazel&nbsp;or Green</li><li><strong>Body measurements</strong>: 32-24-32 inches&nbsp;or 32-24-33 inches</li><li><strong>Skin color</strong>: White</li><li><strong>Hair color</strong>: Blonde</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Her_Secrets_of_Strength_and_Optimism></span>Her Secrets of Strength and Optimism<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kim Norvell has faced many challenges and difficulties in her life, but she has never given up or lost hope.
