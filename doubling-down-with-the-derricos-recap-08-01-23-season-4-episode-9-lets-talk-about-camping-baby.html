Their current home was just too small. They have fourteen kids and between areas for homeschooling on top of a music room has left them with little space for themselves. Hence the new house.</p><p>It’s just looking for the house was proving to be more daunting than they thought it would be. Deon’s friend Lee was helping them look for houses in the area. He told them it was going to be a million dollars more than their planned budget if they wanted at least seven bedrooms.</p><p>Lee was over at the house when the kids mentioned they wanted room to go camping. Lee thought it was a great idea. He would think so. He was white.</p><p>The Derricos however were black and Deon and Karen weren’t the camping type. They said it sounds like the beginning of a horror movie. All it would take was for them to see another black person running and they’ll do the same. Lee would be the only one that stayed put to wonder why everyone is running. He said as much. And so the Derricos held a family vote.</p><p>They asked everyone who wanted to go camping to raise their hands. Unfortunately, the majority voted to go camping. They wanted to sleep in tents. They wanted to cook by a fire. Karen went to an outdoor store and she got everything she thought they’ll need.</p><p>She even bought mountain lion repellent. It was made from the urine of mountain lions. The kids all tried to sniff it. They also asked questions about what would happen if the girl mountain lion spells the boy mountain lion’s pee? Will she leave? Will she attack?</p><p>Some of the kids mentioned the mountain lions will try to get “something, something”. Others said they would French kiss. One also mentioned canoodling.</p><p>The adults asked them how did they know about that and they said what the internet tells them it is. So, Karen realized she had to put up stronger security on their internet access. They also realized it’s time to have that conversation with the twins and the quintuplets. Deon has already had that chat with the older kids. He now has to talk to the younger ones about it.</p><p>Karen left him to it because she never got that talk from her mother. All her mother told her when she was growing up was that she couldn’t come home with a baby. Karen waited until she was married before having kids only she has no clue how to give the talk. Deon has more experience. He also had GG. GG was a teen mother. She told her sons everything they needed to know. GG also said that she didn’t want to sleep in a tent and so she was going to sleep in the RV that they rented to go camping.</p><p>Later, when they went out into the woods, they set up their camping gear. GG then told Karen that she has to be a part of the sex talk with the kids. She said kids will always have questions and it’s best if the parents were the ones to give them those answers or they might look for answers for themselves. Those were usually wrong answers. But being out in the woods had brought up a lot of fears for everyone. The family were the only ones out in those woods at night. They began worrying when they overheard sounds from outside.</p><p>The sounds, the bugs, and then the lightning was what drove them all into the RV. Deon and Karen said camping wasn’t for them. The kids were over it as well. It was one thing for it to rain, but the lighting was too much. That was dangerous. They all slept with Gigi in the RV. They tried camping again the next day. The kids were all out playing. They were looking for snakes. They had fun that next day and Karen was quietly crying to herself because she dreaded taking the kids back to the cramped house.</p><p>They really need a new house. Karen felt bad about how cramped things were back home. She wanted to give them space where they can run around and have a true backyard. Karen was sad that they haven’t found a new house that she just didn’t have the energy to have the talk with the kids. She tried to leave the talk to others. She wanted GG to talk to the girls while Deon talks to the boys. Only GG reminded Karen that this was the job when she became mom. And so Karen did eventually tell her girls about sex.</p><p>She mentioned consent. She mentioned peer pressure. She also said that sex could be a beautiful thing whether you’re married or not. Deon had pretty much the same conversation with the boys. Deon had later heard that a house he was interested in had become available. He wanted to check that out, but he couldn’t because they had bad internet service out in the woods. And so it wasn’t until he did get service that he found out the tenant was going to stay in the house and that they lost the dream house.</p><p>They were staying where they were.</p><p>The family tried to keep camping in the meantime. They roasted marshmallows and made smores. They were also glad to show that a black family can camp. And were even happier when they left the camping ground behind them.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnlKTCo7jIp55mnJ%2Bsu27DyK2fZqyYmnqlsdGroJyno2K%2Fpq%2FAqWRpcF1lfm5%2BkmaqnpmjpLtugIyep6Krn5myboWMpZytq12prq23jJqZqK2kYrCiuc%2BipaBlkpavuns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./donald-trumps-mugshot-released-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Donald Trumps Mugshot Released: Photo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joanie-robach-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-291453-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joanie Robach Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebration-in-verse-form-html.html>Celebration in verse form</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelan-sisti-net-worth.html>Michelan Sisti Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lawrence-long.html>Lawrence Long (Jeopardy) Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-norvell.html>Who is Kim Norvell?
