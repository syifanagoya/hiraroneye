He is the youngest of six siblings, including three sisters. He was a student of The Citadel in Charleston, and after that attended the University of South Carolina, graduating in 1985 with a BS, then in 1991 with a master’s degree in Business Administration. Prior to becoming a politician, he established Ravenel Development Corporation, a company focused on commercial real estate. In 2004, he ran for the US Senate, after Fritz Hollings retired, however, he finished in the third place of The Republican primary election; afterwards Thomas endorsed Jim DeMint who DeMint won the Republican runoff. Subsequently, Thomas ran for the position of the South Carolina Treasurer in 2006, and went on to defeat Grady Patterson, who had been on that position for the nine previous terms. After that, he endorsed <a href=#>Ron Paul</a> in Republican primaries of 2012.</p><p>Ravenel was the chairman of The State Board of Financial Institutions of South Carolina. Additionally, he was a member of The Budget and Control Board for the state and a member of The State of South Carolina Retirement System, an organization that focuses on the retired state employees and for that sake invests about $30 billion. Besides that, Thomas is also a member of several state and national organizations that focus on free enterprise and liberty, including The Cato Institute, located in Washington.</p><p>Thomas has been a member of Bravo TV’s reality series “Southern Charm” since 2014, which portrays southern culture through several personalities, and is now in its fifth season.</p><p>When it comes to his private life, Ravenel was married to Katy Ryan from 1996-98. His subsequent partnership with&nbsp;Kathryn C. Dennis has produced a daughter and a son. However, this politician has had drug related problems, and in 2007 US Attorney Reginald Lloys accused him of federal cocaine distribution charges, of purchasing less than 500 grams of cocaine, and he was suspended from his job by Governor Mark Sanford. He underwent a rehabilitation program in Arizona in the same year, however, he returned there once again in September of the same year, only to confess that he intended on buying cocaine again. In 2008, he was sentenced on drug charges and was supposed to spend 10 months in prison.
