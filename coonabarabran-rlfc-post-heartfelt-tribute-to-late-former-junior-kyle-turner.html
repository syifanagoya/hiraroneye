everyone is excited.”</p><p>Turner was still playing reserve grade as recently as July 22, winning club points in a 32-2 thumping of Dunedoo.</p><p>South Sydney released a statement on Saturday afternoon, describing Turner as a “gentle giant with an infectious smile”, and confirming that they would wear black armbands in his honour for their game against Newcastle on August 20.</p><p>“A proud Kamilaroi man and Coonabarabran Unicorns junior, Mr Turner joined the Rabbitohs in 2011, the year in which he won the Rabbitohs under 20s Player of the Year Award,” the club said in a statement.</p><p>“He will be remembered as a gentle giant with an infectious smile and a crowd favourite amongst the Rabbitohs faithful, as is evidenced by his award as The Burrow Player of the Year in 2016.”</p><p>Rabbitohs CEO Blake Solly said Turner was “an amazing human being”.</p><p>“Kyle was an amazing human being,” Solly said.</p><p>“He epitomised the country boy Rugby League player. He was such a tough, uncompromising player on the field, yet a lovely, generous man off the field.</p><p>“We offer our full support to his family and friends at this very difficult time, and he will always be remembered at our Club as a man that delivered a premiership to the Rabbitohs, but also a man that connected deeply with his communities.</p><p>“We will hold him close to our hearts for the rest of this season and in the years to come. Vale Kyle Turner.”</p><p>Tributes are flowing for the former NRL star online, with many fans expressing their shock over the tragic news.</p><p>“Rest in peace Kyle Turner. So sad to hear he has passed away,” one woman wrote on Twitter.</p><p>“He is a great player and a 2014 premiership winner. I met him at Eastgardens in 2016, thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.”</p><p>Other NRL fans agree Turner was “taken too soon”.</p><p>One person wrote online: “Always a 2014 Rabbitoh premiership player, taken away too soon. Only the good die young.”</p><p>Another person said the news was “terrible”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“(He) was always one of the nicest and most welcoming guys at Souths, and someone you were genuinely happy to see win a premiership in 2014,” the social media user wrote.</p><p>“Thinking of all his family and friends, along with everyone at Souths and Coonabarabran.”</p><p><i>- with NCA NewsWire</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfo7%2Bte8KopqeZkpa%2Foq7RmqVmqpybsG68zqyrZqCVlr%2B1ssSlq2asop6vtsDEZquoZZyWwaZ5xaippp2iYre2usioqWajqaGybsDUq6Weql%2Bjsri%2FjKyrqKqpZLJzscNvmHBtaWuwdLHDmmhqaZSXs6WxkGlsbJyVaq55</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./destinations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best hotels in Tallinn | Telegraph Travel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-sandler-create-cinematic-sandlerverse-characters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Sandler Wants To Make A Cinematic Universe With All His Characters</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebration-in-verse-form-html.html>Celebration in verse form</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michelan-sisti-net-worth.html>Michelan Sisti Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lawrence-long.html>Lawrence Long (Jeopardy) Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kim-norvell.html>Who is Kim Norvell?
